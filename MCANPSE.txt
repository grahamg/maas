Abstract

   This document describes MCANPSE, a HTTP protocol extension to
   allow a webserver to express on the availability of the fast
   food sandwich in question.

1. Rationale and Scope

   The standard HTTP status codes are designated ranges designed
   around specific response categories, broadly as follows:

      1xx   Intermediate Responses, Protocol control
      2xx   OK
      3xx   Redirect
      4xx   Client Error
      5xx   Server Error
      6xx   I'm a McRib sandwich, please eat me asap.
      7xx   McRib sandwich transport deliery error.

   Increasingly, home and consumer devices are being connected to the
   Internet and the need has arisen for a more colloquial and holistic
   approach to the dry and technical responses we have used previously.
   We propose that the protocol be extended to include further ranges of
   codes to express higher order concepts, in this example, sarcasm.
